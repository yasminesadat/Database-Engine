# Database Engine 
This project mimics the behavior of a real Database Engine that supports index creation. By seamlessly integrating **B+ tree indexing** and **binary search algorithms**, our engine delivers efficiency across selects, inserts, updates, and deletes. With a focus on performance optimization, our engine offers two advanced query interpretation modes: precedence-based select statements (AND > OR > XOR) and left-to-right ordering, ensuring precision and flexibility in query execution. Using **ANTLR**, a grammar has been created, which makes the database and its queries come to life.
